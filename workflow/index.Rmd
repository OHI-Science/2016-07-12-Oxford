```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. make a new repo with gh-pages branch, clone it
2. learn markdown, practice
3. learn Rmarkdown, practice data wrangling with gapminder data (index.rmd)
4. introduce ggplot briefly, and interactive graphics
5. push to github.com; new website!
6. add their neighbor as a collaborator to their repo
7. practice more; make changes to their repo, and to their neighbor's.
