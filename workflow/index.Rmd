# Objectives


1. make a new repo with gh-pages branch, clone it
2. learn markdown, practice
3. learn Rmarkdown, practice data wrangling with gapminder data (index.rmd)
4. introduce ggplot briefly, and interactive graphics
5. push to github.com; new website!
6. add their neighbor as a collaborator to their repo
7. practice more; make changes to their repo, and to their neighbor's. 

# Create repository with gh-pages branch

1. [Create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) called `my-project`. This is just like we did this morning. It's good to create new repos for new projects.

    `r img(src='img/github_repo-create.png', width=200)`
    
    Please be sure to tick the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**. Otherwise defaults are fine.
    
    `r img(src='img/github_create-my-project.png', width=600)`

1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) called `gh-pages`.

    `r img(src='img/github_create-branch_gh-pages.png', width=200)`
    
    This morning we were able to view our rendered .html pages online with rawgit. But a `gh-pages` branch lets you have a clean url, which will be `http://USER.github.io/REPO` (see more info at [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com) and [User, Organization, and Project Pages - Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)).
    
1. [Set the default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) to `gh-pages`, NOT the default `master`.

    `r img(src='img/github_default-branch_gh-pages.png', width=600)`
    
1. [Delete the branch](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-branches-in-your-repository/#deleting-branches) `master`, which will not be used.

# Clone the repo to your computer

Do this with RStudio if it's working for you, or with the GitHub Desktop App. 

# Intro to Markdown

Let's learn markdown by editing the `README.md` on our local computer. A README.md file can be added to every folder in a repository, and they are automatically displayed when the repository is opened on github.com  

The `README.md` is in **markdown**, simple syntax for conversion to HTML. `.md` is a kind of text file, so you only need a text editor to read it. You can do this right in RStudio, which has a built-in text editor. (You could also do it in another text editor program, but RStudio is convenient). Copy-paste the following into your `README.md`: 
  
```
# my-project

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates **software** and _formats_:

1. **Git**
1. **Github**
1. _Markdown_
1. _Rmarkdown_

## Conclusion

```
    
Now click on the Preview button to see the markdown rendered as HTML.

![](img/rendered_markdown.png)
    
Notice the syntax for:

- **numbered list** gets automatically sequenced: `1.`, `1.`
- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **link**: `[](http://...)`
- **image**: `![](http://...)`
- _italics_: `_word_` 
- **bold**: `**word**`

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio:

See [Mastering Markdown Â· GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and add some more personalized content to the README of your own, like a bulleted list or blockquote.
For on the fly rendering, the [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor is good.

We're not going to spend more time with Markdown now, but remember:

## Sync (Pull, Commit, Push) this README.md 

# Rmarkdown from RStudio

## Create RStudio Project

Open RStudio and under the menu File -> New Project... -> Existing Directory. Browse to the folder where you previously cloned `my-project`.

`r img(src='img/rstudio_file-new-project-existing-dir.png', width=300)`

You'll notice a couple new files created in the Files pane:

- `.gitignore` stores all the files for git to ignore committing
- `my-project.Rproj` stores the settings for this project

Open the Github Desktop App, enter a message like "new RStudio project" and click on "Commit and Sync gh-pages". This will update <https://github.com/USER/my-project>.

`r img(src='img/github-app_new-rstudio-proj-commit.png', width=300)`

## Create `index.Rmd` in Rmarkdown

Back in RStudio, let's create a new Rmarkdown file, which allows us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots.

File -> New File -> Rmarkdown... -> Document of output format HTML, OK.

`r img(src='img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png', width=300)`

You can give it a Title of "My Project". After you click OK, most importantly File -> Save as `index` (which will get named with the filename extension `index.Rmd`).

Some initial text is already provided for you. Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML".

Notice how the markdown is rendered similar to as before + **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo=FALSE`.

Before we continue exploring Rmarkdown, return to the Github Desktop App, enter a message like "added index" and click on "Commit and Sync gh-pages". This will update <https://github.com/USER/my-project>, and now you can also see your project website with a default `index.html` viewable at <http://USER.github.io/my-project>
