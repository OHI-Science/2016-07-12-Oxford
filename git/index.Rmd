# Outline

We will learn about version control using git and GitHub. git will track and verison your files, GitHub stores this online and enables you to collaborate with others (and yourself). Although git and GitHub are two different things, distinct from each other, I think of them as a bundle since I always use them together. It also helped me to think of GitHub like Dropbox: you make folders that are 'tracked' and can be synced to the cloud. GitHub does this too, but does much more: you have to be more deliberate about when syncs are made, and GitHub saves these as different versions, with information about who contributed when, line-by-line. This makes collaboration lovely. And it allows you to roll-back to different versions or contribute to others' work easily too. 

In this workshop, we'll interface with GitHub from our local computers using GitHub's Desktop App, and a touch of the command line. But there are many other ways to interact with GitHub, including RStudio. [Here](http://stat545.com/git02_git-clients.html) is a list Jenny Bryan has put together. You have the largest suite of options if you interface through the command line, but the most common things you'll do can be done through one of these other applications (i.e. the GitHub Desktop App).

*Note:* Today's materials were developed for and borrowing from 

- Ben Best's Software Carpentry Workshop at UCSB [Reproducible workflow and Version control with Git, Github, and R Markdown](http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB/git/)
- Jenny Bryan's lectures from STAT545 at UBC: [The Shell](http://stat545.com/git09_shell.html)


# Git and Github

- **Git** is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg doc, pdf, xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). You can rollback changes made by you, or others. This facilitates a playground for collaboration, without fear of experimentation (you can always rollback changes).

- **Github** is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between [images](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-and-diffing-images/), [rendering](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/) & [diffing](https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps) map data files, [render text data files](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/), and [track changes in text](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-differences-in-prose-documents/).

## Setup Github & Git

1. Create **Github** account at <http://github.com>, if you don't already have one. For username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. I recommend using your *.edu email*, since you can request free private repositories via [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) discount.You're encouraged to upload a picture since it will get included in the students listing as part of this course repository.

1. Configure **git** with global commands. Open up the Bash version of Git and type the following:

        # display your version of git
        git --version
        
        # replace USER with your Github user account
        git config –-global user.name USER
        
        # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github
        git config –-global user.email NAME@EMAIL.EDU
        
        # list your config to confirm user.* variables set
        git config --list

## Git and GitHub: Why use them?




## Create Repository `my-project`

Now you will create a Github repository for a project.

1. [Create a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) called `my-project`.

    `r img(src='img/github_repo-create.png', width=200)`
    
    Please be sure to tick the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**. Otherwise defaults are fine.
    
    `r img(src='img/github_create-my-project.png', width=600)`

1. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) called `gh-pages`.

    `r img(src='img/github_create-branch_gh-pages.png', width=200)`
    
    Per [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com), since this will be a project site only web files in the `gh-pages` branch will show up at `http://USER.github.io/REPO`. For a user (or organization) site, the REPO must be named `USER.github.io` (or `ORG.github.io`) and then the default `master` branch will contain the web files for the website `http://USER.github.io` (or `http://ORG.github.io`). See also [User, Organization, and Project Pages - Github Help](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).
    
1. [Set the default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) to `gh-pages`, NOT the default `master`.

    `r img(src='img/github_default-branch_gh-pages.png', width=600)`
    
1. [Delete the branch](https://help.github.com/articles/viewing-branches-in-your-repository/#deleting-branches) `master`, which will not be used.

## Edit `README.md` in Markdown

[Commit your first change](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change) by editing the `README.md` which is in **markdown**, simple syntax for conversion to HTML. Now update the contents of the `README.md` with the following, having a link and a numbered list:
  
```
# my-project

Playing with [Software Carpentry at UCSB](http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB).

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates **software** and _formats_:

1. **Git**
1. **Github**
1. _Markdown_
1. _Rmarkdown_

## Conclusion

![](https://octodex.github.com/images/labtocat.png)
```
    
Now click on the <span class="octicon octicon-eye"></span> Preview changes to see the markdown rendered as HTML:
    
`r img(src='img/github_preview_README-md.png', width=500)`
    
Notice the syntax for:

- **numbered list** gets automatically sequenced: `1.`, `1.`
- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **link**: `[](http://...)`
- **image**: `![](http://...)`
- _italics_: `_word_` 
- **bold**: `**word**`

See [Mastering Markdown · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and add some more personalized content to the README of your own, like a bulleted list or blockquote.

## Create `index.html`

By default `index.html` is served up. Go ahead and create a new file named `index.html` with the following [basic HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## Clone Repository

[Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote) onto your local machine. The easiest way to do this is simply clicking the button <span class="octicon octicon-desktop-download"></span> to open up the Github Desktop App.

`r img(src='img/github_clone-desktop.png', width=300)`
    
You'll be prompted to clone this repository into a folder on your local machine. I recommend creating a folder `github` under your user folder.
  
See [GitHub Desktop User Guides](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/) for more. You could also do this from the Bash Shell for Git with the command `git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git`, replacing USER with your Github username and REPO with my_project. Or you can use the Github Desktop App menu File -> Clone Repository...

Note: from Jenny Bryan ([Test drive RStudio and GitHub](http://stat545.com/git07_git-github-rstudio.html)): 

>There’s a big advantage to the “Github first, then RStudio” workflow: the remote GitHub repo is now the “upstream” remote for your local repo. This is a technical but important point about Git. The practical implication is that you are now set up to push and pull. No need to fanny around on the command line or in another Git client.

# Rmarkdown from RStudio

## Create RStudio Project

Open RStudio and under the menu File -> New Project... -> Existing Directory. Browse to the folder where you previously cloned `my-project`.

`r img(src='img/rstudio_file-new-project-existing-dir.png', width=300)`

You'll notice a couple new files created in the Files pane:

- `.gitignore` stores all the files for git to ignore committing
- `my-project.Rproj` stores the settings for this project

Open the Github Desktop App, enter a message like "new RStudio project" and click on "Commit and Sync gh-pages". This will update <https://github.com/USER/my-project>.

`r img(src='img/github-app_new-rstudio-proj-commit.png', width=300)`

## Create `index.Rmd` in Rmarkdown

Back in RStudio, let's create a new Rmarkdown file, which allows us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots.

File -> New File -> Rmarkdown... -> Document of output format HTML, OK.

`r img(src='img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png', width=300)`

You can give it a Title of "My Project". After you click OK, most importantly File -> Save as `index` (which will get named with the filename extension `index.Rmd`).

Some initial text is already provided for you. Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML".

Notice how the markdown is rendered similar to as before + **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo=FALSE`.

Before we continue exploring Rmarkdown, return to the Github Desktop App, enter a message like "added index" and click on "Commit and Sync gh-pages". This will update <https://github.com/USER/my-project>, and now you can also see your project website with a default `index.html` viewable at <http://USER.github.io/my-project>

## Github Workflows

The two most common workflow models for working Github repositories is based on your permissions:

1. **writable**: Push & Pull (simplest)

1. **read only**: Fork & Pull Request (extra steps)

### Push & Pull

repo location | `USER` permission | initialize <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> | edit <i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> | update <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i>
-----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:
<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> `github.com/OWNER/REPO` | read + write | [**create**](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) <span class="octicon octicon-plus"></span> |   |
<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> `~/github/REPO`      | read + write | [**clone**](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote) <span class="octicon octicon-desktop-download"></span> | [**commit**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) <span class="octicon octicon-git-commit"></span>,  [**push**](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) <span class="octicon octicon-cloud-upload"></span> | [**pull**](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/#pull) <span class="octicon octicon-cloud-download"></span>

Note that OWNER could be either an individual USER or group ORGANIZATION, which has member USERs.

### Fork & Pull Request

repo location | `USER` permission | initialize <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> | edit <i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> | update <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i>
-----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:
<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> `github.com/OWNER/REPO` | read only |  | [**merge**](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request) <span class="octicon octicon-git-merge"></span> [BB]  | 
<i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> `github.com/OWNER/REPO`    | read + write | [**fork**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) <span class="octicon octicon-repo-forked"></span> | [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) <span class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request"></span> | [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) <span class="octicon octicon-git-pull-request"></span>, [**merge**](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request) <span class="octicon octicon-git-merge"></span>
