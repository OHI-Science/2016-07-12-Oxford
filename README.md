Come say hello: 
 
- Instructor: Julie Lowndes and Iain Emsley
- Host: Mike Burgass and Carlyn Samuel
- Helper: Martin Hadley

In the workshop we'll use the sticky notes to indicate whether everything is OK (blue) or not (yellow).

**If you've successfully installed everything listed in the [setup instructions](http://jules32.github.io/2016-07-12-Oxford/#setup), please put a blue sticky note up on your laptop.** And put up yellow if you need help. Today we'll just be using R and RStudio, so if you need help with the others we can have a look during a break.

Also, please download the course's [zipped data file](https://github.com/jules32/2016-07-12-Oxford/raw/gh-pages/2016-07-12-Oxford.zip).

If you need wifi access please see Mike. Eduroam works here. 

Toilets are out at the end of both corridors; the closest is just past our room to the right.
